# miluka zone 6x8 - medium format camera
Revive classic lenses with my innovative medium format camera body—compatible with Mamiya RB67 6x7/6x8, Graflock 23, or Horseman 6x9 backs (Horseman 8exp back exposes 56x78mm due to 78mm-wide film gate). Salvage Tessar, Novar, Solinar, or Apotar optics from vintage folders like Zeiss Ikonta or Agfa Isolette. All 75-105mm lenses fully supported depending on image circle, covering up to 6x8. Precision-milled from hardwood, POM, or 3D-printed for flawless alignment and smooth focusing via M65 helicoids (17-31mm). To manufacture with CNC, use 2 20mm boards, plus M4 screws and M4 locknuts. Add tripod mount and hot shoe for pro setups. Eco-friendly upcycling meets modern reliability—capture stunning film shots affordably!
